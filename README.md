#### README

This repository contains the code that was used to generate analysis and plots for **"Extra-nucleolar Pol I regulates gene transcription through chromatin domain maintenance"**. For data used in this publication, a public repository has been set up on [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/stash/share/wGKlTXjBvL9uBW8HgMOMgermP0dki79WXs25JnSZxM4). To regenerate our anlysis, clone [this Github repository](https://github.com/BackmanLab/Transcription/), download the Dryad repository, and change the root directory to where you have stored the Dryad repository. Scripts used specifically to generate figures are organized by analysis type under <kbd>/Transcription/Figures/</kbd> . Each subdirectory contains a markdown file with code + figures. All additional scripts used to generate analysis are organized by analysis under <kbd>/Transcription/ ..analysis.. </kbd>  . Most of these contain a markdown with notes on usage and application of analyses. GEO submissions for this publication have not been publicly released yet. [RNAseq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE279127) , [HiC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE279166), and [Cut&Tag](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE279081) raw and processed data will be released to GEO upon publication.
